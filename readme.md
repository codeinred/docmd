# Doc MD: A Source-To-Markdown Documentation Generator

Doc MD is a documentation generator which reads comments and generates markdown.

## Why?

HTML documentation generators tend to be powerful but inflexible, and many have terrible default styles. This aims to circumvent that problem entirely by outputting the documentation in Markdown, which can then be hosted with a static site generator; compiled into an epub; converted into a pdf; or translated into whatever other form you desire!

## How?

Simply run `docmd` in the root directory of your project!
